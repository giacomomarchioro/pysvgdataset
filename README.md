This Python script allows you to create a modified `.svg` rappresenting a flat samples collection. A flat samples collection is a group of flat samples (e.g. some pieces of metals with different varnishes, a series of coloured tile ...). The samples are contained in a samples holder that can be used as reference system.

### Create, automate measurments and visualize
The `.svg`use the standard color coding of laser cutters so you can cut the samples and the samples holder with your laser cutter. If you don't have one you can find a [FabLab next to you](https://www.google.com/maps/search/fablab/) or use an [online service](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+laser+cutting).

Once you have your physical samples collection,if you have a positioning system (microscope stages, linear stages etc. etc) you can use the coordinates inside the `.svg` file for positioning your instrument on the sample (or the part of the sample) you are interested in.

The `.svg`can be read with any browser. The mouse over tooltip can show to anybody what's the last layer of your sample.
